Pong
This is a C++ version of the classic video game pong. It employs the SDL2 library for rendering geometry, text, and audio. Starting from rudimentary skeleton files, I created this game within 2 weeks as an assignment for my Game Design course in Spring 2025. During development, I learned the basics of SDL2 for 2D graphics rendering, as well as other fundamental concepts in game design like game clocks, gameplay loops, and difficulty curves.
